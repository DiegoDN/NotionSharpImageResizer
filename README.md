## **Notion Sharp Image Resizer** ##


### Features
---
- This is a simple utility that creates images to put as cover on Notion Posts.

- Just load the Book Covers (or drag 'n' drop them into main window) and that's it.

- This tool does 2 things:
   * Create a backgroung for your images
   *  Resize your images to Notion's standard size.

### Motivation

If you use the life organizer [Notion](https://www.notion.so/product) you might have your books colletion on it.

When you build a list of posts as a collection like this:

You can create a Cover View, like a bookshelf and your posts will appear like this:

This tool does 2 things:

 1. Create a backgroung for your images
 2. Resize your images to Notion's standard size.

This is an image of Tolkien's Silmarillion cover.

This is the same image, adjusted by this app.

When you use this utility on all your cover books, your book cover view will look like this:

I got the idea from this tool from an online service, created by Luke Denton and posted on reddit.  You can check it here: https://notionimages.netlify.app/

The output from his online version and mine are similar.  I've created this tool to have it offline (just in case his page gets offline).
